# Description of the project
The aim of the project we have created is to showcase an accurate simulation of different aspects of nature. This simulation of a natural environment is inhabited by different animals and shows how they move and interact in the wild. Animals such as birds, frogs, and snails can be seen and controlled using the UI in the scene.

# Instructions for use
* Left and right arrow keys to move camera
* Right click on mouse for UI
  
  
  


# How it works
The birds are boids, which model the flocking behavior of birds seen in nature. Each boid follows the three primary rules of separation, alignment, and cohesion to create a more realistic flocking behavior. The birds are confined to a fixed radius around the scene to ensure they stay in frame. The snails navigate the scene using a navmesh; their movement is slow and random to replicate the movement of snails in nature. The frog in the simulation leaps from one lily pad to another in a pond, similar to what is commonly seen in a real-life environment. It calculates the height difference from the first lily pad and creates an arc using a sine wave for the jump height, continuing in a loop as it jumps from one lily pad to the next.

# What we are most proud of in the assignment
We are both very proud of how this assignment has turned out, particularly in terms of its visual appeal and how it simulates nature, achieving realistic behaviors in the three animals: birds, frogs, and snails. The immersive environment we created accurately simulates how different life forms function in nature. We are proud of the realistic movements each animal displays and how immersive the scene looks and feels with the moving and changing environment. Being able to change the environment and the animals behaviors adds to the user's immersion, and it's something we are really proud of.

# What we learned
This was both our first time making a simulation of something rather than an actual game you can play, so we had to approach the design process differently than we usually would. We had to think of it more like directing a scene rather than creating gameplay for a game. We had to do a lot of research on how we would approach making a simulation visually appealing and immersive to the user rather than a player who would focus more on the gameplay side of things rather than how immersive and how it feels to experience.
