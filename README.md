# What we are most proud of in the assignment
Myself and Oran both like the idea we've come up with. It's a fun assignment and the brief we we're given aligns with what we enjoy creating in Unity. I am most proud of our synergy in this project and I feel like myself and Oran can achieve a lot by the time its due.

Another thing we are proud of us achieving our goal in the end. We started this project with a vision and now that we have finished it we felt like we did a good job in making our idea into a reality. We are mainly proud of the atmosphere we created within our game, we felt like we really achieved the feeling of being a DJ in a packed club playing music and making sure the crowd is enjoying their time.

# What we learned
This was both of our first times attemtping to make a game in VR so we both had to go through the process of learning how to set it up. It was a daunting task at first and was a lot different to what we were usually used to during our early phases of development but after a lot of research and testing we managed to get what we needed done. Towards the end the process of setting up Virtual Reality within our game ended up becoming an enjoyable task as the results felt nice. It was good to learn something new and to get it to work.

Another thing we learned is how to find the best optimal settings for our game. We didn't know this before, but optimising the VR controls for your game is very important and there's a lot that goes into it. Examples being, hand motion tracking accuracy, look sensitivity, what buttons felt comfortable for the player to press. We went through various different routes before coming to a conclusion on what felt best for our game.

We also learned that creating a good atmosphere that suits your games setting can be a big difference. Once we added in the particle effects and the crowd dancing based on the volume of the music it really changed our entire game. At first our game felt like it had no soul and it was very stiff, but by the end after some tweaks our game felt very alive and fluid.
